## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a secure, scalable, cloud-native microservices platform built using DevOps and DevSecOps best practices. It integrates:

- Microservices containerization (Docker + ECS)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform on AWS)
- Continuous integration/deployment (GitHub Actions)


---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Develop containerized microservices (Flask)
- Automate infrastructure provisioning using Terraform
- Build CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment
